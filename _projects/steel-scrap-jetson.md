Built and deployed a drone‑mounted computer vision system on **NVIDIA Jetson** for automated, energy‑aware **steel scrap sorting**. Integrated hybrid DL–neuromorphic design principles and developed a carbon‑footprint benchmarking toolbox that cut evaluation time by ~40%.

**Highlights**
- Edge deployment on Jetson (CUDA/TensorRT/ONNX)  
- Energy profiling + optimization  
- Robust detection under industrial conditions
