Hi! I’m **Ahsan**, a Computer Vision engineer and researcher with 3+ years of experience across **ML**, **Image Signal Processing (ISP)**, and **3D Computer Vision**. I specialize in low-light enhancement, energy‑efficient/neuromorphic ML, and reconstruction/inverse rendering—often on **embedded**/**edge** platforms like NVIDIA Jetson.

- Currently finishing an **M.Sc. Visual Computing** at Saarland University (2022–2025).
- Previously at **DFKI** (neuromorphic + energy‑aware AI) and **10xEngineers**/**Rapid Silicon** (ISP pipelines, denoising, demosaicing).

➡️ Check out the **Projects** tab for selected work, and the **Photos** tab for a lighter side of life.
